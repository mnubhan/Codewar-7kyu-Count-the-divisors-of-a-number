# Codewar-7kyu-Count-the-divisors-of-a-number
Count the number of divisors of a positive integer n.
<br><br><br><br>
Random tests go up to n = 500000.
<br><br>
Examples (input --> output)
<br>
4 --> 3 (1, 2, 4)
<br>
5 --> 2 (1, 5)
<br>
12 --> 6 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12)
<br>
30 --> 8 (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30)
<br><br>
Note you should only return a number, the count of divisors. The numbers between parentheses are shown only for you to see which numbers are counted in each case.
